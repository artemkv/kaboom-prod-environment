- auto-assign public ip (MapPublicIpOnLaunch on subnet?)
- You are creating an internet-facing Load Balancer, but there is no Internet Gateway attached to these subnets you have selected
    - ELB should be in a public subnet, not instances
    - You must create public subnets in the same Availability Zones as the private subnets that are used by your private instances. Then associate these public subnets to the internet-facing load balancer.
    - If a subnetâ€™s default traffic is routed to an internet gateway, the subnet is known as a public subnet.
    - If a subnet's default traffic is routed to a NAT instance/gateway or completely lacks a default route, the subnet is known as a private subnet.
